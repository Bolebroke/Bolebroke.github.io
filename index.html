			<h2>What is drag hunting?</h2>
			<p>Drag hunting is the sport of using hounds to follow an artificial scent that is dragged along the ground by a trail layer. In the Bolebroke beagle pack we use an aniseed scent. When drag hunting, the trail layer gets a head start and will sometimes jog as far as 15km through farmland, woodland, moors, marshes and anywhere else we've been invited. Only the trail layer knows where they've been, so we have to use the hounds noses to follow the trail and find the trail layer! The followers can be as active as they choose - keep up with the hounds, or find a nice vantage point to watch them from a distance. We're a social bunch, and our followers often enjoy long conversations and making friends whilst watching the hounds work.</p>
			<p class = 'last'>We only ever follow a plant-based aniseed scent, and we are always focused on the welfare of both our hounds and the wildlife that we interact with.</p>
